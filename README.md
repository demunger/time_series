### Techniques and Applications of Time Series Analysis

Included above are samples of notebooks demonstrating random process simulations, as well as implementations of time series analyses.

* `bbm.ipynb`: a two-dimensional branching Brownian motion simulation, including functions to compute density autocorrelation and particle clustering
* `fft.ipynb`: comparison of physical and Fourier space convolution methods on speed and accuracy
* `pca.ipynb`: a one-dimensional diffusion simulation, with an application of principal component analysis

*This repository draws on work from Spring 2017 Time Series Analysis and Stochastic Processes.*
